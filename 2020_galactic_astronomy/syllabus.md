### Class meetings

The class meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:40 pm to 2:00 pm online.

### Communication and Slack

The primary vehicle for communication regarding this course will be [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/).
Specifically, there is a `kerzendorf-galactic-lecture2020` channel in the [AstroMSU](https://5fcw2e.stackhero-network.com) mattermost workspace. Contact me if you do not have access to this service yet. Discussion of course subject material and problems is encouraged.
You may also send direct messages via mattermost to the instructor or any other member of the workspace.

### Text book and references

See [Resources](resources.rst) in the main folder for a link to resources. See the resources.rst file in each of the lecture subfolders for resources for that specific lecture.


### Assignments

There will be reading and problem sets assigned on a roughly bi-weekly basis. See [Assignments](assignments.md) for a complete listing (forthcoming 2nd week of class). See the resources.rst in each folder for the assigned watching of videos and reading. You will be expected to complete the reading _prior_ to class as not _all_ the reading material will be covered in lecture, but you _will_ need to know it in order to complete the problems. 

Group work on the problem sets is encouraged and you are encouraged to turn in the problem sets with a maximum of 2 names assigned. No rule of scholarly activity is more important than giving proper credit to the contributions of others. Although you are free to work with classmates on assignments, you must explicitly acknowledge them by name and indicate their contributions in your final write-up. 

### Projects

You will be required to complete a final project for the course. The details about the final project will be forthcoming

### Final exam

There will be no final exam but you will be required to make a presentation about your final project.

### Grading policy

The weights for the course grade are as follows.

Category                   | %
-------------------------- | ---
Problem sets               | 40%
Final project              | 50%
In-class participation     | 10%

The final course grade will be assigned based on the following scale.

Grade        | Overall %
------------ | ----------
4.0          | >=90
3.5          | >=83
3.0          | >=76

2.0          | >=62
1.5          | >=55
1.0          | >=45

Your final grade will be no lower than that indicated on the above scale, though it _may_ be higher, depending on overall class performance.

As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard.
